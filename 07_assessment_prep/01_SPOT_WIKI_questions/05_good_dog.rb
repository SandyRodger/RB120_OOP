puts sparky.info 
# => Spartacus weighs 10 lbs and is 12 inches tall.

# We expect the code above to output `”Spartacus weighs 45 lbs and is 24 inches tall.”` Why does our `change_info` method not work as expected?

# Because the change_info variables need @ symbols in front of them to turn them into instance variables, rather than variable names (which reference the values they were originally set with)
