What is encapsulation, and why is it important in Ruby? Give an example.

	Encapsulation is an attempt to protect data from accidental manipulation, by limiting the code that has access to it. This is important because it allows large complex code structures to be built without different parts manipulating each other unintentionally. It also allows the code designer to think more abstractly by hiding the implementation of methods. 

	Encapsulation is achieved through Method Access Control, which is the use of access modifiers to set which methods are acessible by the public interface.
