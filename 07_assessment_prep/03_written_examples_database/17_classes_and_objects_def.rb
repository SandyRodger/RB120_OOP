What is the relationship between classes and objects in Ruby?

Classes are lists of behaviours and attributes which act as blueprints. Objects are then created from these classes which have access to these behaviours and attributes. Objects cannot access classes which are not their own, although they can be passed into other objects as collaborator objects. Objects must be instatiated before they can implement any behaviours, but classes do not.
