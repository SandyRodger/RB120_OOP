Currently, the code below raises an error. By only modifying two lines of code in the IceCreamScoop class, update the code snippet below so that the last line outputs the expected value. Explain the modifications that you made and why they fixed the code. What is the difference between the two lines of code that you modified?

  def initialize(flavor, double=false)
    @flavor = flavor
    @double = double
    @@total_scoops += 1

  end

  def make_it_a_double_scoop
    double = true

  attr_accessor :double

  def update_total_scoops

end

my_scoops = IceCreamScoop.new('strawberry')

Your Answer
Lines 16 needs self. to prepend total_scoops and line 12 needs self. to prepend double. This is because the total_scoops method called in line 31 is a class method, and class methods are defined with self in order to specify that the calling object is the class itself. In line 12 the self keyword is necessary to call the double= setter method rather than initializing a new local variable within the method, which is what happens otherwise, meaning that @double is still false in line 25.
