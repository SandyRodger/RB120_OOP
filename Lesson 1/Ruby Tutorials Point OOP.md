Ruby is a pure Object Oriented Language. (what does that even mean?)

	- Everything appears to Ruby as an object. (ie Strings, Numbers, True, False)

A class combines the representation of the data and the methods for manipulating it. (state and behaviour?) These are called members of the class (here, not in the LS book(?))

A class provides the blueprint for its objects.
